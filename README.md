# Module 10 Challenge 

## Jupyter Notebook Database Connection
- Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to your SQLite database
- Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect your tables into classes
- Save references to the classes named station and measurement
- Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session
- Close your session at the end of your notebook

## Precipitation Analysis 
- Create a query that finds the most recent date in the dataset (8/23/2017)
- Create a query that collects only the date and precipitation for the last year of data without passing the date as a variable
- Save the query results to a Pandas DataFrame to create date and precipitation columns

## Sort the DataFrame by date
- Plot the results by using the DataFrame plot method with date as the x and precipitation as the y variables
- Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data

## Station Analysis
- Design a query that correctly finds the number of stations in the dataset
- Design a query that correctly lists the stations and observation counts in descending order and finds the most active station (USC00519281)
- Design a query that correctly finds the min, max, and average temperatures for the most active station (USC00519281) 
- Design a query to get the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data that filters by the station that has the greatest number of observations
- Save the query results to a Pandas DataFrame (2 points)
- Correctly plot a histogram with bins=12 for the last year of data using tobs as the column to count. 

## API SQLite Connection & Landing Page (10 points)
- Correctly generate the engine to the correct sqlite file 
- Use automap_base() and reflect the database schema 
- Correctly save references to the tables in the sqlite file (measurement and station)
- Correctly create and binds the session between the python app and database 
- Display the available routes on the landing page

## API Static Routes
### A precipitation route that:
- Returns json with the date as the key and the value as the precipitation
- Only returns the jsonified precipitation data for the last year in the database

### A stations route that:
- Returns jsonified data of all of the stations in the database

### A tobs route that:
- Returns jsonified data for the most active station (USC00519281)
- Only returns the jsonified data for the last year of data 

## API Dynamic Route
### A start route that:
- Accepts the start date as a parameter from the URL 
- Returns the min, max, and average temperatures calculated from the given start date to the end of the dataset 

### A start/end route that:
- Accepts the start and end dates as parameters from the URL 
- Returns the min, max, and average temperatures calculated from the given start date to the given end date 

## Coding Conventions and Formatting 
- Place imports at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.
- Name functions and variables with lowercase characters, with words separated by underscores.
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, creating maintainable and reusable code.
- Use concise logic and creative engineering where possible.

## Deployment and Submission 
- Submit a link to a GitHub repository thatâ€™s cloned to your local machine and contains your files.
- Use the command line to add your files to the repository.
- Include appropriate commit messages in your files.

## Comments
- Be well commented with concise, relevant notes that other developers can understand.
